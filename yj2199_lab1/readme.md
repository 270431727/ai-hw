Release all the input file in the same director with the codes.
Mention: for all three search algo I used a visited set, so notice the answer may be different.

enviroment: python 3.7+

If the input has error,such as some nodes in vertexs are not existed,the code will report'wrong input'.

To use bfs / ids/a* algorithm:
open bfs.py/idp.py/a*.py file,and write the input file name in line 123(for bfs),line 177(for idp),line 181(for a*)
For example, if the input file names: ex1.txt, line 123 should be: a='ex1.txt'.(Node:the apostrophe is required)

After filled in the input file name,save and exit the .py code,and using'python bfs.py' to run.
